# France_Server

This project was done as part of a five man team for the University of Melbourne Capstone Project.

Method for checking out and running this project:
You will need installed on Windows or MAC:
  - Android studio v 3.1.3
  - Relevant SDKs (Android Studio should do this easily)
  - Git
  
You will need to make sure that Android studio is aware of Git: in Android studio go to File -> Settings -> Version Control -> 
Git and try pressing test (if it doesn't work, make sure the "Path to Git Executable" has a path ending in git.exe).

Next, in Android studio go VCS (top bar with File etc.) -> Checkout from version control -> GitHub
You should be able to login to GitHub and choose France_Server to clone. Once it is cloned, make sure you have a virtual phone 
emulator ready (try doing this in another test project if you do not already have one) and click the green right facing triangle (Run) 
and you should see a screen with "Bounjour... ".
